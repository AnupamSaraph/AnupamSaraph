# 👋 Hi, I’m Anupam Saraph  
**Future Designer | Strategic Innovation Advisor | Complex Systems Thinker**

---

## 🌍 About Me
With 4+ decades at the intersection of technology, governance, and environmental systems, I specialize in designing and reasoning about complex sociotechnical and ecological systems—scaling from organizations to cities, nations, and the globe. My work has led to pioneering:
- 🌀 Feedback-based governance frameworks  
- 🔁 Intervention strategies across sectors  
- 📊 Dynamic system models for public, private, and academic use

Internationally recognized by [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/people/anupam-saraph/) and others for advancing systems modeling, public policy, and governance innovation.

## 🛠️ What I Do

### System Modeling & Reasoning  
- Architecting dynamic, actor-based, life-cycle models to enable evidence-driven decisions  
- Reasoning from causal logic in narrative data

### Strategic Foresight & AI  
- Bridging legacy expert systems with LLMs and causal inference tools  
- Designing governance simulations using AI-integrated models

### Leadership & Capacity Building  
- Developing leadership-ready systems intelligence tools  
- Enabling systemic interventions through frameworks and training

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Modeling Tools

Languages and platforms I work with:
- Python (Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Plotly)
- Systems Simulation (Stella/iThink, Vensim, SysLogic)
- Multi-agent Frameworks (CrewAI)
- Web Interfaces & Documentation (HTML, CSS)

Exploring modular toolchains that integrate causal logic, simulation, and interactive visualization.

## 🎓 My Foundations

- **PhD, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (1994)**  
  Developed actor-based and systems life-cycle theories  
  Formalized reasoning-from-evidence approaches for system modeling  
  Introduced proposition-based and theorem-driven simulation paradigms

## 🧭 Let’s Build Together

> Designing the future requires understanding systems, reasoning from evidence, and empowering leaders to transform complexity into opportunity.

I welcome collaboration that challenges boundaries across modeling, code, and civic imagination.
